Echo of the Past started as a class assignment to learn Unreal Engine basics, but I fell in love with the engine and spent months turning it into my biggest indie project yet. What began with keywords "future" and "resource management" evolved into a combat RPG where the last remaining androids must travel back in time to prevent humanity's self-destruction.

## ‚öîÔ∏è What Makes This Special

Echo of the Past showcases **complex, interlocking gameplay systems** built with C++ and Blueprint integration. Every feature was designed with **performance and maintainability** in mind.

### üéØ Core Combat Features
- **Dual Combat Modes**: Seamless melee/ranged switching with different mechanics for each
- **Dynamic Combo System**: Timing-based combos with critical hit finishers
- **16 Unique Weapons**: 8 melee + 8 ranged with distinct stats and behaviors
- **Smart Weapon Pickups**: Visual stat comparison when hovering over better gear

### ü§ñ Advanced AI Systems
- **Behavior Tree Intelligence**: Modular AI that adapts based on player actions
- **Multi-Sensory Detection**: Enemies see, hear footsteps, gunshots, and sword attacks
- **Dynamic Combat Roles**: Same AI framework handles both melee and ranged enemies
- **Stagger Mechanics**: Timing-based vulnerability windows for tactical gameplay

### üîß Technical Solutions I'm Proud Of

**3D Aiming in a Crosscode-Inspired System**: Solved cursor accuracy in 3D by creating custom trace channels hitting an invisible plane through the player's center‚Äîno more missed shots due to perspective issues.

**Custom Occlusion System**: Built my own character visibility solution after third-party plugins caused crashes. Material functions set opacity masks to 0 when objects block the camera, with a Python script automatically applying this to all materials.

**Event-Driven UI Architecture**: HUD subscribes to GameMode and Player delegates for reactive updates. No polling, no desync‚Äîjust clean separation between gameplay and presentation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Deep Dive

The codebase follows **component-driven design** with event-based communication. Here's how the major systems work together:

### Component Architecture
```
GameMode Components (Global State):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PauseHandlerComponent     ‚Üí OnPaused(bool)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TimerComponent           ‚Üí OnTimeUp, OnTimeUpdated, On60SecRemaining  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LevelManagerComponent    ‚Üí OnOpenLevelTransition

Player Systems:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AttackManagerComponent   ‚Üí Combat logic, weapon swapping, combos
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HealthComponent         ‚Üí OnDeathAfterDelay  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AmmoManagerComponent    ‚Üí OnAmmoChanged
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ControllerEventsComponent ‚Üí OnPauseMenuCommand
```

### Key Implementation Highlights

**Weapon Swapping System** ([View Code](Source/EchoOfThePast/Private/Components/AttackManagerComponent.cpp#L45))
```cpp
void UAttackManagerComponent::SwitchWeapon(const TSubclassOf<ABaseWeapon>& WeaponClass, bool bIsSwitchingToMelee)
{
    if (IsValid(CurrentWeapon)) CurrentWeapon->Destroy();
    
    FActorSpawnParameters Params; 
    Params.Owner = OwnerCharacter;
    CurrentWeapon = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<ABaseWeapon>(WeaponClass, FTransform::Identity, Params);
    CurrentWeapon->AttachToComponent(
        OwnerCharacter->GetMesh(),
        FAttachmentTransformRules::SnapToTargetNotIncludingScale,
        CurrentWeapon->SocketName
    );
}
```

**Event-Driven HUD Updates** ([View Code](Source/EchoOfThePast/Private/HUDs/MyHUD.cpp#L89))
```cpp
void AMyHUD::OnPaused(bool IsPaused)
{
    const auto Vis = IsPaused ? ESlateVisibility::Collapsed : ESlateVisibility::Visible;
    if (MinimapWidget) MinimapWidget->SetVisibility(Vis);
    if (GameHudWidget) GameHudWidget->SetVisibility(Vis);
}
```

## üé® Behind the Scenes

### The Story That Drives Everything
Four androids remain on a barren Earth‚Äîhumanity's last consciousness. Using the final resources, they build an unstable time portal. Only one can go back to key moments in human history, slowing down the evolution that led to destruction. But with each mission, you grow weaker... after all, you are humanity's **greatest creation**.

### Technical Challenges Solved
- **Cross-Code Integration**: Seamless Blueprint/C++ workflow for rapid iteration
- **Performance Optimization**: Component-based architecture eliminates unnecessary updates
- **Shader Programming**: Custom materials for melee radius visualization and occlusion
- **Python Automation**: Material batch processing for consistent occlusion behavior
- **Niagara VFX Integration**: Damage numbers with physics-based randomization

## üîÆ Future Vision

While Echo of the Past represents my biggest solo project to date, I see it as a foundation for even more ambitious work. The systems I built here‚Äîmodular AI, event-driven architecture, and performance-conscious design‚Äîare patterns I'll carry into professional game development.

### What I Learned
- **Component-driven design** scales better than monolithic systems
- **Event-based communication** eliminates tight coupling between systems
- **Performance matters early**‚Äîarchitecture decisions compound over time
- **Polish makes the difference** between a demo and a game people want to play

### Potential Expansions
- Further balancing gameplay
- Procedural mission generation for infinite replayability
- Advanced AI director adjusting difficulty dynamically
- Further improving the combat to resemble the complexity of a souls like game
